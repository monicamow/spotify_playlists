    "I'm addicted to Spotify. What gets me somewhat excited for Monday morning is a little nugget called *__Discover Weekly__*. It's a playlist of recommended songs based on a user's preferences, which I'm guessing is based on play history. It's a machine learning-powered playlist generated by those magicians at Spotify. A software engineer explains how these song recommendations are made [here](https://medium.com/s/story/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe).\n",
    "\n",
    "My Discover Weekly playlist is hit or miss. Sometimes I find a few really good songs in there, but other times the majority of the songs are just \"meh\". So I decided to create a playlist of songs that I KNOW I like, and a playlist of songs that I KNOW I do not like. I'll combine these tracks into one playlist and use them as training data to feed into a machine learning algorithm. Once the algorithm is sufficiently trained, the hope is that it will be able to create me a customized Discover Weekly playlist.\n",

    "I use the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library to access the Spotify Web API. I've pulled all the songs from the playlists and saved data on popularity score and associated features into CSV files. This was a two step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get all the song IDs and popularity scores from each of the \"like\" and \"don't like\" playlists\n",
    "    - The popularity score on a song is attached to my user ID. I believe it is based on how much I play the song.\n",
    "2. Obtain features for each song\n",
    "    - The song features are tied to a song ID"
