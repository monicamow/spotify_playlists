    "I'm addicted to Spotify. What gets me somewhat excited for Monday morning is a little nugget called *__Discover Weekly__*. It's a playlist of recommended songs based on a user's preferences, which I'm guessing is based on play history. It's a machine learning-powered playlist generated by those magicians at Spotify. A software engineer explains how these song recommendations are made [here](https://medium.com/s/story/spotifys-discover-weekly-how-machine-learning-finds-your-new-music-19a41ab76efe).\n",
    "\n",
    "My Discover Weekly playlist is hit or miss. Sometimes I find a few really good songs in there, but other times the majority of the songs are just \"meh\". So I decided to create a playlist of songs that I KNOW I like, and a playlist of songs that I KNOW I do not like. I'll combine these tracks into one playlist and use them as training data to feed into a machine learning algorithm. Once the algorithm is sufficiently trained, the hope is that it will be able to create me a filtered Discover Weekly playlist.\n",

    "I use the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Python library to access the Spotify Web API and obtain data on song features."
